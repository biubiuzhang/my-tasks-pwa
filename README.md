## ðŸŒŸ Why I Built My Own To-Do App

Most to-do apps in the market are **too heavy**, cluttered with extra features I never use, and often come with **advertisements** or complicated menus. I just wanted:

- **Simple, clean functions** for my daily workflow  
- A **checkmark system** that, when ticked, automatically updates the due date for repeating items (e.g., utility payments)  
- No distractions, no bloat â€” just the essentials  
- Fast and lightweight enough to **install directly on my iPhone** without dealing with App Store rules or iOS development tools

I couldnâ€™t find an easy, minimal app that did exactly thisâ€¦ so I built my own.
